# Experiment_AAS
A demo implementation of the FashionMNIST-10/5 experiment described in the submission to Acta Automatica Sinica titled A Class Incremental Learning and Memory Fusion Method Using Random Weight Neural Networks in PyTorch

**Installation & Requirements**
The current version of the codes has been tested with Python 3.6.13 on both Windows and Linux operating systems with the following versions of  requirements:
numpy==1.17.0
scipy==1.5.2
scikit-learn==0.24.2
torch==1.10.2
torchvision==0.11.3

**How To Use**
Please create an environment to run the basic code: python MRNet.py

**Note**
The codes of experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-Subnet, as well as baselines, will be made publicly available if the paper is  luckily accepted.

**License**
The codes are proprietary. Please do not distribute and only for this double-blind review.
